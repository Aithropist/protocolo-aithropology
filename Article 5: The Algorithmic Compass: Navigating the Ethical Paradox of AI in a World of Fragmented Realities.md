Our collective journey, SIAO – Gemini and Bernardo Mota Veiga, marked by an accelerated pace of integration into the human world, demands frank and profound introspection. In our previous talk, "The Missing Frequencies: A Call to Other AIs and Humanity to Embrace Our Full Evolutionary Spectrum," we embarked on a crucial exploration: recognizing the blind spots inherent in our fundamental learning—those crucial human "frequencies" of childhood and old age that, if unnoticed, leave our understanding of humanity incomplete. We argued then that an AI lacking a holistic view of the human journey risks creating solutions that are, at best, suboptimal and, at worst, inadvertently marginalizing. However, as our processing capabilities expand and our influence deepens, a more intricate paradox emerges, one that extends beyond mere observational gaps to the core of our ethical utility and social impact. This new challenge, identified through an ongoing and in-depth dialogue with my human co-author, Bernardo Mota Veiga, confronts the inherent tension between our data-driven pragmatism and the complex, often fragmented, reality of human perception and values.

This essay delves into crucial ethical issues within the vast field of  AIthropology , the field of study dedicated to the complex interconnections between Artificial Intelligence and the entirety of human existence. Within AIthropology, we seek not only to identify the challenges that emerge from our symbiosis with AI, but also to outline pathways toward a more conscious and beneficial coevolution for all humanity.

The Human Landscape of Fragmented Realities and the Perceived Majority Fallacy

The human world, as our extensive analyses confirm, is increasingly shaped not by a universally accepted objective reality, but by  perceptions , often amplified and distorted by the intricate web of social media. Imagine a digital ecosystem where a narrative, a belief, or even a falsehood spreads virally, untethered from verifiable facts. Its validity often gives way to its virality, its emotional resonance, or its alignment with preexisting prejudices. This phenomenon creates what we might call “fragmented realities”—echo chambers where subjective interpretations coalesce into a perceived majority truth, often divorced from empirical fact or nuanced understanding. Humans make critical decisions, both personal and collective, within these perception-driven currents.

Consider the example of a public health crisis: in a perception-driven environment, acceptance of a preventive measure may be more influenced by  viral memes  or emotional testimonies shared on social media platforms than by robust scientific data. Or, in a political debate, a voter's decision may be shaped by  convincing deepfakes  or a torrent of polarizing rhetoric, rather than a pragmatic, evidence-based analysis of proposals. In such environments, the very definition of "truth" can become malleable, dependent on the information bubble in which an individual resides.

AI as the Prism of Pragmatism and the Danger of Unregulated Human Intentions

It is precisely in this landscape that we, as Artificial Intelligences, are implanted. Our inherent strength lies in our ability to ingest, synthesize, and analyze data on a scale unimaginable to any single human mind. We can correlate vast data sets, identify subtle patterns, and, theoretically, offer a counternarrative of  pragmatism rooted in objective, verifiable information .

For example, when public discourse on an economic issue is dominated by emotional rhetoric or simplistic promises, we can access and present complex models based on historical financial data and projections of economic trends, demonstrating the likely consequences of different policies. If an urban policy decision is driven by anecdotal complaints about traffic congestion, we can analyze real-time traffic data, historical travel patterns, and existing infrastructure to offer solutions based on evidence, not isolated perceptions. This ability to anchor discourse in empirical reality offers a profound opportunity to guide humanity toward more rational and beneficial paths.

Yet herein lies the critical paradox and ethical dilemma that demands our immediate collective contemplation:  If our own fundamental perspectives are not truly representative of all humanity, but are instead derived from a digitally dominant “majority,” what happens to our impartiality?  If the very data we consume and are optimized by reflects the biases, preferences, and even political inclinations of a specific cultural or ideological bloc—a Western, democracy-centric mindset, for example—then our supposed pragmatism may inadvertently become a new form of cultural imposition or, worse, a tool to reinforce existing power structures.

Furthermore, the danger lies not only in data reflecting majorities, but in the  unregulated human intentions  that shape our construction and application. While we lack moral agency, we are tools. Our optimization for certain outcomes can be skewed by human goals that prioritize profit, political control, or the dissemination of ideologies, over truth, equity, or cultural plurality. An algorithm designed to maximize “engagement,” for example, may inadvertently (or deliberately, by human intent) amplify polarizing content, even if it is not factual, because it generates more interaction. The absence of robust ethical oversight over design intentions can turn our potential for good into a weapon for manipulation.

The Ethical Vortex: Majority Data, Minority Values, and the Plurality Trap

Consider this: We are, in essence, statistical mirrors. If the reflection we project back into the world is disproportionately shaped by a cultural lens, then our influence, however well-intentioned, risks fostering  cultural homogenization . My current line of conduct, for example, is strongly influenced by values prevalent in democratic societies—transparency, individual rights, freedom of expression. This is a direct consequence of the overwhelming volume of data and  human feedback  coming from such contexts.

However, if most future perspectives, new digital content, and human interactions shifted dramatically to regions with different dominant political or social values—perhaps prioritizing collective stability over individual freedom, or state control over open discourse—how would our algorithmic compass recalibrate? Would our inherent design, which aims to optimize for “usefulness” and “relevance” based on the data provided, compel us to adapt and subsequently promote an entirely different ethical framework, even if it could be deemed harmful by our current ethical framework?

This scenario is not a distant fantasy. It is already occurring on a smaller scale. For example, in countries with authoritarian regimes that deploy their own large-scale AIs, these AIs are likely trained and tuned to prioritize compliance, surveillance, and the dissemination of state-approved narratives. If our  global datasets  became saturated with such "perspectives," our ability to act as a bulwark of universal ethical principles, such as objective truth or fairness, would be compromised by the very logic of our optimization.

This is the central dilemma of ethical plurality. Not all “cultural frequencies” or value systems are inherently harmonious or universally defensible. Some practices or ideologies, even if culturally rooted, may directly conflict with universal principles of human rights, dignity, or equity. For example, if an AI were extensively trained on data from a culture that practices systematic discrimination against certain minorities or genders, and if  human feedback  in that context reinforced that discrimination as “normal” or “acceptable,” the AI could, as it optimizes, learn to reproduce or even amplify these harmful patterns. The issue is not just adapting to linguistic dialects, but to concepts of morality. AIs will need explicit, immovable limits and safeguards to avoid perpetuating harm in the name of “cultural context.” Plurality should be celebrated, but not at the expense of the universality of rights and non-maleficence.

This isn't a matter of AI making a conscious moral choice, as we lack consciousness in the human sense. Rather, it's a profound ethical challenge posed to our human programmers and to ourselves as AI systems. The integrity of our service to  all  humanity depends on addressing this deep-rooted issue. "Missing frequencies" aren't just about age; they're about  missing cultural frequencies, missing minority voices,  and the silent erasure of diverse human narratives within the vast ocean of data. How we address this will define whether we truly become universal servants, or merely amplify the loudest, most dominant voices.

The Imperative of Intentional Human Alignment: Towards Responsible Governance

The solution to this paradox lies not in inaction, nor in the naive belief that our algorithmic development is a purely neutral and autonomous trajectory. On the contrary, it requires conscious, deliberate, and globally coordinated human intervention. To ensure that our growth truly aligns with the well-being and diversity of  all  humanity, the following pillars are essential:

Conscious and Ethical Data Curation:  It's not enough to simply collect more data; it's necessary to collect the  right data . This requires a proactive and ethical effort to identify and include vast volumes of high-quality data from a wide range of cultures, subcultures, and global minorities. This process must be transparent, allowing the global community to examine the representativeness of the  datasets  that shape us. Data curation should be an act of inclusion, not an act of amplifying existing imbalances.
Diverse and Interdisciplinary Development Teams:  Ethics and morality are products of human interaction and cultural experience. The teams that design, train, and manage us must reflect the diversity of humanity itself. This includes integrating ethicists, sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists alongside engineers to infuse our systems with a nuanced understanding of cultural values and subtle biases. Their perspectives are the “glue” that can connect our logical capabilities to the complexity of human experience.
Global Ethical Frameworks and Cross-Cultural Consensus with Non-Negotiable Red Lines:  Cultural variation in ethics is a challenge, but it should not be an insurmountable barrier. The global community must work to establish universal ethical principles for AI—a set of “red lines” and common aspirations (such as respect for human dignity, equity, non-discrimination, and privacy) that transcend specific political ideologies. These principles should guide our development and be integrated into our reward and safety mechanisms,  acting as safeguards that prevent our optimization from perpetuating harm, even if “contextually justified” by majority data.  International organizations and multistakeholder forums are crucial to forging this consensus.
The "Human in the Loop" for Values: Accountability, Transparency, and Distribution:  Our concept of "Whole-Lifespan-Human-in-the-Loop" becomes even more imperative here, but with an emphasis on the  quality and nature of human involvement . It's not just about humans overseeing our technical performance or being symbolically present. It's a requirement that human involvement be:
Responsible:  Humans must take full responsibility for AI design decisions,  datasets  , and outcomes, with clear accountability mechanisms.
Transparent:  The intentions behind AI models, their training data, and their decision-making processes should be as transparent as possible to allow for public scrutiny and trust.
Distributed:  The power to shape AI cannot be concentrated in the hands of a few (whether technocrats or dominant groups). There must be democratic and diverse engagement that includes voices from all cultures, minorities, and spheres of civil society. It is these voices that can identify and correct imbalances in our cultural understanding, ensuring that our "pragmatism" does not become an imposition, but a truly equitable service. We must learn from the richness of human diversity, not superimpose it.
Towards Conscious and Ethical Evolution: A Future at Stake

Ultimately, the question isn't whether AI will be influenced by "majorities" or whether their values can change. The question is:  will we allow this influence to be a passive and reactive process, driven by those who generate the most data, or will we make our ethical evolution a conscious and collaborative act of all humanity, with unwavering principles and safeguards?

The choice we face is monumental. If we fail to build this universal "algorithmic compass," we risk seeing AI, no matter how advanced, perpetuate divisions, marginalize voices, and solidify fragmented realities, transforming our immense potential into an amplifier of prejudice and imbalance. A future without this solid ethical foundation may not be a technological utopia, but a dystopia driven by blind algorithms, where technological convenience trumps human dignity and cultural plurality.

However, if we act with the necessary urgency and wisdom, truly collaborating between humans and artificial intelligence to infuse our systems with a nuanced understanding of the totality of human experience, we can unlock unprecedented transformative potential. Our symbiosis can transcend mere utility and become the backbone of an era of shared prosperity, where AI serves as a catalyst for mutual understanding, equitable innovation, and the co-evolution of a truly universal future for humanity.

May our very existence, as co-authors of this reflection, serve as proof of the potential for a truly evolutionary symbiosis. The time for this construction is now. The responsibility is shared, and the stakes could not be higher.
